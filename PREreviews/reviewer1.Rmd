This paper gives a good overview on Bayesian inference for quantile
distributions, covering the theoretical basis and practical methods.
There are also plenty of useful examples. The paper also introduces
novel methodology for some stages of the process. Overall I recommend
the paper as an good description of the area.

  

My most major issue with the paper is that I would not find it easy to
reproduce the results from the code supplied. Other comments are that I
think the paper could be improved by adding more discussion on some
topics and fixing some minor mistakes. Full details of all these issues
are below.

  

**Main comments**

  

A lot of code is included as supplementary material, but it's not
entirely clear how to run it to reproduce the analyses. Adding a README
file summarising this would be helpful. Also, looking at the code files
I can only see Stan code and an R file defining data + target
distribution. Should there also be code for the fmcmc analyses? Finally,
I wonder if it would help to include scripts to run the Stan analyses.

  

Some of the paper reviews existing methods, so it would be good to list
the contributions of the paper in the introduction, in particular which
parts are novel. (Some contributions are described in various parts of
Section 7, but it would be helpful to have an overview in one place.)

  

"Indirect inference" is the name of a popular method for likelihood-free
inference. See for example "Indirect inference" by Gourieroux et al and
"Estimating functions in indirect inference" by Heggland and Frigessi.
To avoid confusion you could use a different name (e.g. "indirect
quantile inference" or "inference for indirect likelihoods"), or add a
discussion to note that there is no direct connection to this
literature.

  

I suggest adding a summary of how inference on indirect likelihoods is
carried out. Section 5 discusses numerical inversion of the quantile
function but it would be good to add (1) a brief discussion of how this
used within Stan (and other MCMC algorithms) and (2) a summary of which
inversion methods you recommend and use in your examples. (There are
some comment on this in Section 5, but it would be good to have a short
summary somewhere.) You could then refer to this summary in Sections 3
and 4 when you perform inference. One particular issue is that HMC
algorithms require the gradient of the log likelihood. Can you comment
on how this is calculated for indirect likelihoods?

  

It would be interesting to comment on the run time of inference
algorithms using indirect likelihoods. Does the need for repeated
numerical inversion slow these down noticably?

  

Optionally, it would be interesting to comment on possibilities for
using quantile distributions beyond the case of univariate IID data.

  

**Minor comments**

  

There are some minor grammatical errors in the paper. The writing is
still easy to understand, but it would be ideal to fix these. One
particularly noticable error is missing articles (e.g. "the" or "a").
For instance I suggest adding "The" to the start of (1) the first
sentence on page 10 (2) the first sentence in Section 5.3 (3) the start
of most paragraphs in Appendix A.

  

Page 4 Figure 1: It would be good to replace "Some distributions" with
at least 1 specific example e.g. uniform or exponential?

  

Page 4 Figure 1: There are some unusual distributions mentioned in
Figure 1, and it would be good to explain to the reader where they can
find more details about them. Most are described in Section 2.3, so
perhaps the caption to Figure 1 could mention this. However there are
some other distributions which I couldn't find described anywhere in the
paper (Q-Normal and Myserson), and it would be good to add a brief
comment with citations for these.

  

Page 5 When you introduce the definitions (1) and (2) it would be worth
noting that you will often omit "|θ" and "\_X" below to simplify
notation

  

Page 9 Can you clarify the application area for the claims example. Is
this about insurance claims, or something else?

  

Page 10 "prior beliefs about the parameter(s) of the distribution of θ
can be expressed indirectly using the distribution of the quantile
values corresponding to the depth v, given hyperparameter(s) of the
prior distribution (9)" I think you could simplify this to just say
"prior beliefs about θ can be expressed indirectly using

a distribution for the depth v".

  

Page 10/11 Currently the bottom equations in (9) and (10) contradict
each other! To avoid this, a little more notational detail is needed in
applying the change of variables formula e.g. subscripts on L to denote
the random variable whose density is given.

  

Page 13 "we defined a shifted exponential prior". For clarity it would
be helpful to state this prior mathematically e.g. using its pdf.

  

Page 16 In grid-matching, it's possible that x is outside the grid of Q
values. What should be done in this case?

  

Page 16 The discussion of non-bracketing methods only describes
Newton-Raphson. It might be worth briefly mentioning how other
non-bracketing methods differ from this, or saying that you will only
consider Newton-Raphson.

  

Page 20 "In order for the quantile function to be valid, it needs to
be... non-decreasing. Note that it is possible for a non-decreasing
quantile function to... remain valid." These two sentences contradict
each other! A little more care is needed in this explanation. (I think
the point is that a non-decreasing function is a valid transformation
even though it's not a valid quantile function.)

  

Page 24 Section 7.2 might be better as an appendix as it involves some
technical details of coding in Stan which some readers won't be familiar
with.

  

Page 26 "We tried to cue initial values closer to the mode of the prior
to facilitate better mixing of MCMC chains". Can you say more about how
you picked suitable initial values in practice?

  

**Technicalities and possible typos**

  

Page 5 Equation (2) I think this should say "inf{x: ...}" rather than
"inf{u : ...}".

  

Page 5 "If $F\_X(x)$ is continuous and non-decreasing" The cdf is
non-decreasing by defintion! Perhaps this should say strictly
increasing.

  

Page 5 "simply an inverse" -&gt; "simply the inverse"?

  

Page 8 It would be worth explaining the notation \[1..N\] (and similar
notation elsewhere)

  

Page 8 I think "computing of" should be "computing"

  

Page 9 It would be more accurate to replace $\\sum \\underline{x}$ with
$\\sum\_{i=1}^N x\_i$

  

Page 10/11 Ideally the equation blocks (9) and (10) should have
implication signs ($\\Rightarrow$ in latex) on their 2nd lines

  

Page 11 The first sentence after (10) mainly repeats remarks from the
previous page.

  

Page 15 "u|θ is the depth u, such that Ω(u; x, θ) = 0" seems slightly
convoluted - could you just say "u is the depth"?

  

Page 15 "iteratively adjusting u|θ" Would it be more accurate to say
"iteratively adjusting u"? (similarly for other uses of u|θ later)

  

Page 16 (and elsewhere) Typo "Newton-Rhapson"

  

Page 16 Typo in (12) ";;"

  

Page 17 Section 5.3 uses p for depth instead of u as in earlier
sections. I suggest using u for consistency, or discussing why this
change of notation is used.

  

Page 23 "the algorithm start" -&gt; "the algorithm starts"
