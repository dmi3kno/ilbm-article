  abstract = {In this paper, the class of T-R \{generalized lambda\} families of distributions based on the quantile of generalized lambda distribution has been proposed using the T-R\{Y\} framework. In the development of the T-R\{Y\} framework, the support of Y and T must be the same. It is typical that the random variable Y has one type of support and T is restricted to the same support. Taking Y to be a generalized lambda random variable leads to three different types of supports, thus, making the choice of the generator T to be much more broad and flexible. This is interesting and unique. By allowing T with different supports makes the T-R\{generalized lambda\} a desirable method for generating new versatile and broad families of generalized distributions for any given random variable R. Some general properties of these families of distributions are studied. Four members of the T-R\{generalized lambda\} families of distributions are derived. The shapes of these distributions can be symmetric, skewed to the left, skewed to the right, or bimodal. Two real life data sets are applied to illustrate the flexibility of the distributions.},

  abstract = {A growing number of generative statistical models do not permit the numerical evaluation of their likelihood functions. Approximate Bayesian computation has become a popular approach to overcome this issue, in which one simulates synthetic data sets given parameters and compares summaries of these data sets with the corresponding observed values. We propose to avoid the use of summaries and the ensuing loss of information by instead using the Wasserstein distance between the empirical distributions of the observed and synthetic data. This generalizes the well-known approach of using order statistics within approximate Bayesian computation to arbitrary dimensions. We describe how recently developed approximations of the Wasserstein distance allow the method to scale to realistic data sizes, and we propose a new distance based on the Hilbert space filling curve. We provide a theoretical study of the method proposed, describing consistency as the threshold goes to 0 while the observations are kept fixed, and concentration properties as the number of observations grows. Various extensions to time series data are discussed. The approach is illustrated on various examples, including univariate and multivariate g-and-k distributions, a toggle switch model from systems biology, a queuing model and a L\'evy-driven stochastic volatility model.},

We briefly review existing companion matrix methods\textemdash robust, but relatively expensive. We then describe a broad family of new rootfinders employing subdivision. These new methods partition the canonical interval, x{$\in$}[-1,1], into Ns subintervals and approximate fN by a low degree Chebyshev interpolant on each subdomain. We derive a rigorous error bound that allows tight control of the error in these local approximations. Because the cost of companion matrix methods grows as the cube of the degree, it is much less expensive for N{$>$}50 to calculate the roots of many low degree polynomials, one polynomial on each subdivision, than to directly compute the roots of a single polynomial of high degree.},

We consider bivariate and time series extensions of the g-and-k distribution under this framework, and develop an efficient component-wise updating scheme free of likelihood functions to be used within the SMC algorithm. In addition, we trial the set of octiles as summary statistics as well as functions of these that form robust measures of location, scale, skewness and kurtosis. We show that these modifications lead to reasonably precise inferences that are more closely comparable to computationally intensive likelihood-based inference. We apply the quantile distributions and algorithms to simulated data and an example involving daily exchange rate returns.},

  abstract = {Summary. Many modern statistical applications involve inference for complex stochastic models, where it is easy to simulate from the models, but impossible to calculate likelihoods. Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) is a method of inference for such models. It replaces calculation of the likelihood by a step which involves simulating artificial data for different parameter values, and comparing summary statistics of the simulated data with summary statistics of the observed data. Here we show how to construct appropriate summary statistics for ABC in a semi-automatic manner. We aim for summary statistics which will enable inference about certain parameters of interest to be as accurate as possible. Theoretical results show that optimal summary statistics are the posterior means of the parameters. Although these cannot be calculated analytically, we use an extra stage of simulation to estimate how the posterior means vary as a function of the data; and we then use these estimates of our summary statistics within ABC. Empirical results show that our approach is a robust method for choosing summary statistics that can result in substantially more accurate ABC analyses than the ad hoc choices of summary statistics that have been proposed in the literature. We also demonstrate advantages over two alternative methods of simulation-based inference.},

  abstract = {In decision analysis, analysts must often encode an expert's uncertainty of a quantity (e.g., the volume of oil reserves in a proven, but undeveloped oil field) using a probability distribution. This is commonly done by eliciting a triplet of low-base-high percentile assessments, such as the \{10th, 50th, 90th\} percentiles, from the expert, and then fitting a probability distribution from a well-known family (e.g., lognormal) to the assessed quantile-probability (or QP) pairs. However, curve fitting often requires non-linear, non-convex optimization over a distribution parameter space, and the fitted distribution often never honors the assessed QP pairs \textendash{} reducing both the fidelity of the model, and trust in the analysis. The development of quantile-parameterized distributions (or QPDs), distributions that are parameterized by, and thus precisely honor the assessed QP pairs, is a very important yet nascent topic in decision analysis, and contributions in the literature are sparse. This dissertation extends existing work on QPDs by strategically developing a new smooth probability distribution system (known as J-QPD) that is parameterized by (and honors) assessed QP pairs. J-QPD also honors various natural support regimes \textendash{} for example: bounded (e.g., fractional uncertainties, such as market shares, are necessarily bounded between zero and one); semi-bounded (e.g., volume of oil reserves is necessarily non-negative, but may have no well-defined upper bound); etc. We then show that J-QPD is maximally-feasible, highly flexible, and approximates the shapes of a vast array of commonly-named distributions (e.g., normal, lognormal, beta, etc.) with potent accuracy, using a single system. This work also presents efficient, high-fidelity methods for capturing dependence between two or more uncertainties by combining J-QPD with modern correlation assessment and modeling techniques. We then provide an application of J-QPD to a famous decision analysis example, demonstrating how J-QPD facilitates rapid Monte Carlo simulation, and how its implementation can aid actual decisions that might otherwise be made wrongly if commonly-used discrete methods are used. We conclude by noting important tradeoffs between J-QPD and existing QPD systems, and offer several extensions for future research, including a first look at designing new discrete distributions using J-QPD.},

  abstract = {In this paper we investigate a Bayesian procedure for the estimation of a flexible generalised distribution, notably the MacGillivray adaptation of theg-and-k distribution. This distribution, described through its inverse cdf or quantile function, generalises the standard normal through extra parameters which together describe skewness and kurtosis. The standard quantile-based methods for estimating the parameters of generalised distributions are often arbitrary and do not rely on computation of the likelihood. MCMC, however, provides a simulation-based alternative for obtaining the maximum likelihood estimates of parameters of these distributions or for deriving posterior estimates of the parameters through a Bayesian framework. In this paper we adopt the latter approach. The proposed methodology is illustrated through an application in which the parameter of interest is slightly skewed.},

  abstract = {We are living in the big data era, as current technologies and networks allow for the easy and routine collection of data sets in different disciplines. Bayesian Statistics offers a flexible modeling approach which is attractive for describing the complexity of these datasets. These models often exhibit a likelihood function which is intractable due to the large sample size, high number of parameters, or functional complexity. Approximate Bayesian Computational (ABC) methods provides likelihood-free methods for performing statistical inferences with Bayesian models defined by intractable likelihood functions. The vastity of the literature on ABC methods created a need to review and relate all ABC approaches so that scientists can more readily understand and apply them for their own work. This article provides a unifying review, general representation, and classification of all ABC methods from the view of approximate likelihood theory. This clarifies how ABC methods can be characterized, related, combined, improved, and applied for future research. Possible future research in ABC is then outlined.},

In many such cases, the nature of the uncertainty is more naturally characterized by quantiles than by parameters of familiar continuous probability distributions. In the practice of decision analysis, it is common to fit a hand-drawn curve to quantile outputs from probability elicitations on a continuous uncertain quantity and to then discretize the curve. The resulting discrete probability distribution is an approximation that cuts off the distribution's tails and eliminates intermediate values. Quantile-parameterized distributions address this problem by using quantiles themselves to parameterize a continuous probability distribution. We define quantile-parameterized distributions, illustrate their flexibility and range of applicability, and conclude with practical considerations when parameterizing distributions using inconsistent quantile assessments.},

The system is comprised of unbounded, semibounded, and bounded distributions, each of which offers nearly unlimited shape flexibility compared to previous systems of distributions. Explicit shape-flexibility comparisons are provided. Unlike other distributions that require nonlinear optimization for parameter estimation, the metalog quantile functions and probability density functions have simple closed-form expressions that are quantile parameterized linearly by cumulative-distribution-function data. Applications in fish biology and hydrology show how metalogs may aid data and distribution research by imposing fewer shape constraints than other commonly used distributions. Applications in decision analysis show how the metalog system can be specified with three assessed quantiles, how it facilities Monte Carlo simulation, and how applying it aided an actual decision that would have been made wrongly based on commonly used discrete methods.This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.

  abstract = {In 2004, Deng and Jiang presented two new probabilistic models based on two classes of new distribution proposed by Jiang (2000). In this paper we investigate how well these two new models work for real financial series in Chinese foreign exchange market, using the data from both USD and EUR exchange data. We find that the new models can provide quite good fitting in these empirical studies.},
